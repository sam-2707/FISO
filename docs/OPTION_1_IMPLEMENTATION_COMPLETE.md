## 🚀 **What's Been Accomplished**

### **1. Enhanced Core Cost Fetcher (`predictor/cost_fetcher.py`)**

#### **Before (Basic Version):**
```python
def get_lambda_pricing(region_code="us-east-1"):
    # Returns basic pricing data only
    return {
        "region": "US East (N. Virginia)",
        "invocation_cost": 0.0000002,
        "gb_second_cost": 0.0000166667
    }
```

#### **After (AI-Enhanced Version):**
```python
def get_lambda_pricing(region_code="us-east-1", enhanced=False):
    # Now supports both basic and AI-enhanced modes
    if enhanced:
        return get_lambda_pricing_enhanced(region_code)
    # Returns enriched data with AI insights, multi-provider comparison, etc.
```

#### **New Features Added:**
- ✅ **AIEnhancedCostAnalyzer** class with intelligent insights
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** - existing code works unchanged
