ds --> automl : Initiates Training

automl --> historical_db : Reads data
automl -> prediction_engine : Deploys Prophet Model
automl -> anomaly_engine : Deploys Isolation Forest Model

prediction_engine --> api : Provides /api/ai/predict-costs
anomaly_engine --> api : Provides /api/ai/detect-anomalies

api --> dashboard : Serves data to frontend
